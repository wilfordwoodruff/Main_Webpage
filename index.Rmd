Brigham Young University - Idaho's Data Science Program and The Research and Business Development Center in partnership with The Wilford Woodruff Papers project are on a journey to incorporate the tools of data science into the editorial process of bringing the writings of Wilford Woodruff out of obscurity. We leverage our Data Science Society, Senior Projects, and Data Science Consulting Class to meet this goal.

## Where do I Start?

Don't worry too much about trying to build something, just start messing around and look for something interesting. You can check out [this link]() to explore the archive of journals and letters. As you look at what he shares, maybe an idea will come to you!

### How Can I Build?
Once you have an idea, check out our Github for the structure of people's projects. Go ahead and "clone" our *Sample Repository*, then start working. When you're ready, send us a request to add it to the collection!
